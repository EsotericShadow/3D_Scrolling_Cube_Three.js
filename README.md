üìÑ **Neon Cube ‚Äì Project Documentation**

---

### Overview

Neon Cube is a futuristic, immersive web experience that showcases a rotating, glowing 3D cube built with Three.js. User interactions via mouse wheel or touch gestures drive the cube‚Äôs orientation changes, creating a dynamic, cyber-themed effect. The project features enhanced rotation logic to ensure that horizontal swipes are applied relative to the cube‚Äôs current vertical orientation. This prevents unintended diagonal rotations by switching the horizontal control axis (Y vs. Z) depending on the cube‚Äôs vertical flip state. The mobile experience has been streamlined by removing text fade effects and increasing cube size for improved usability.

### üîπ index.html

**Purpose:**  
Defines the basic layout and structure of the web app. It includes:

- Google Fonts (Orbitron) for a futuristic typographic style.
- A full-screen flexbox layout comprising:
  - Two vertical text columns for left and right messages
  - A central cube container for the 3D scene
- JavaScript module inclusion via `<script type="module" src="script.js"></script>`

**Key Elements:**

| Element ID / Class       | Description                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `#cube-container`        | Placeholder div where the animated 3D cube is rendered |
| `.text-column.left`      | Left-aligned text column                             |
| `.text-column.right`     | Right-aligned text column                            |
| `#left-text`             | Container for left-side messages                     |
| `#right-text`            | Container for right-side messages                    |

### üé® styles.css

**Purpose:**  
Provides styling for layout, responsive behavior, and visual effects such as glow.

**Key Features:**

- **Background:**  
  Dark vertical gradient (from `#000` to `#222`) establishes a high-contrast, cyberpunk atmosphere.
- **Typography:**  
  The Orbitron font from Google Fonts sets the futuristic tone.
- **Layout:**  
  A fixed, full-screen flexbox design centers the cube and text columns.
- **Responsive Design:**  
  Media queries adjust cube and text dimensions for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Mobile-Specific:**  
  On mobile, the cube is enlarged for better interaction and all text fade/transform animations are removed to simplify the experience.

### üß† script.js

**Purpose:**  
Manages the 3D scene setup, the animation rendering loop, gesture handling, and text transitions using Three.js and DOM manipulation.

**Libraries Used:**

- **Three.js:**  
  Renders the 3D cube and manages the WebGL scene.
- **ES Modules:**  
  The code leverages JavaScript modules loaded via the `type="module"` attribute.

**Key Components:**

1. **üî≤ Cube Construction**

   - **Geometry:**  
     The cube is constructed with a wireframe style using TubeGeometry for each edge.
   - **Layers:**  
     - **Bright Core:** Thin, vivid edges.
     - **Glow Layer:** A thicker, semi-transparent version slightly scaled up to produce a neon glow effect.

2. **üí° Lighting**

   - Uses a single ambient light (`#fff`) to uniformly illuminate the scene.

3. **üß≠ Camera**

   - A perspective camera is positioned at `z = 2`, facing the cube to provide a clear, central view of the animation.

4. **üîÑ Text Blocks**

   - **Content:**  
     Two arrays (left and right) of cyber-inspired messages populate the corresponding text containers.
   - **Animation:**  
     On desktop, text blocks fade and translate vertically in synchronization with the cube‚Äôs rotation. On mobile, text effects are disabled for a cleaner and more performant experience.

5. **üîÅ Animation & Rendering**

   - **Loop:**  
     The main animation loop uses `requestAnimationFrame(updateScene)` for smooth updates.
   - **Interpolation:**  
     Cube rotations are interpolated linearly (using a configurable lerp speed) to ensure smooth, face-to-face transitions.
   - **Visual Feedback:**  
     Both the neon wireframe and text elements update every frame for synchronized feedback.

6. **üß≠ Face Rotation & Orientation Logic**

   - **Vertical Rotation (X-axis):**  
     Vertical swipes adjust the cube‚Äôs rotation around the X-axis in discrete 90¬∞ increments. A `verticalIndex` variable tracks these vertical flips.
   - **Horizontal Rotation:**  
     Horizontal swipes apply rotation relative to the cube‚Äôs vertical orientation:
     - When `verticalIndex` is even (cube is ‚Äúupright‚Äù or inverted), horizontal movements update the Y-axis.
     - When `verticalIndex` is odd (cube is rotated 90¬∞/270¬∞ vertically), horizontal movements update the Z-axis.
   - **Outcome:**  
     This adaptive control ensures that left/right swipes always result in a consistent, viewer-relative flip without unexpected diagonal rotations.

7. **üß≤ Interaction**

   - **Input Methods:**  
     Supports both mouse wheel (desktop) and touch gestures (mobile).
   - **Axis Locking:**  
     Input handlers lock movement to the dominant axis (with additional shift-key handling for forced horizontal gestures).
   - **Threshold & Sensitivity:**  
     Configurable constants (e.g., `swipeThreshold`, `touchMult`) determine the amount of gesture required to trigger a rotation.

8. **Notable Constants**

   | Constant         | Purpose                                                  |
   | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `blocksCount`    | Number of text entries per column                        |
   | `fadeRange`      | Distance (in pixels) over which text fades               |
   | `swipeThreshold` | Minimum delta required to trigger a rotation             |
   | `lerpSpeed`      | Speed factor for rotation interpolation                  |
   | `touchMult`      | Multiplier to adjust the sensitivity of touch gestures   |

### üß™ Future Enhancements

- **Additional Interactions:**  
  Introduce click or tap support for rotating the cube.
- **Dynamic Text Editing:**  
  Allow live updates to cube face text via an integrated editor.
- **Audio Enhancements:**
